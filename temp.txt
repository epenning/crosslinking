Get finished PDBs as list:
find . -type f -name unrelaxed_model_1.pdb | sed -r 's|/[^/]+$||' | tr "." "'" | tr -d "/" | sed "s/$/',/"
find . -type f -name relaxed_model_1.pdb | sed -r 's|/[^/]+$||' | tr "." "'" | tr -d "/" | sed "s/$/',/"



Generate commands to copy finished PDBs to models/<protein>-unrelaxed_model_1.pdb
find * -name unrelaxed_model_1.pdb -exec sh -c 'new=$(echo "{}" | tr "/" "-" | tr " " "_"); echo cp "{}" "models/$new"' \;


Compress finished PDBs:
tar czf models.tar.gz models


Location of compressed PDBs:
/scratch1/08481/epenning/crosslinking/output/models.tar.gz


Generate commands to copy rankings to rankings/<protein>-ranking_debug.json
find * -name ranking_debug.json -exec sh -c 'new=$(echo "{}" | tr "/" "-" | tr " " "_"); echo cp "{}" "rankings/$new"' \;


Compress finished rankings:
tar czf rankings.tar.gz rankings

Visualizations?
Seaborn in Python

Chimera X
* Look at domains (can get from uniprot)
* Compare predicted structures with known from uniprot (for those that exist)
Plot: see PDF

For top 10 XL proteins:
* try running with relax, see if the XL changes
