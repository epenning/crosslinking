Do multimer w/:

2 of them
Pick the smallest one (should be around 1800 AA)

Visualizations?
Seaborn in Python

Current updates:
1. Got the distance calculation for the crosslinks working! Just need to actually do something with them
- See how many crosslinks are >30 distance in AF structure
- Should I try checking distances for residues that didn't have actual crosslinks? Would be a lot
- Visualizations
2. AlphaFold 2.1.2 came out, finally fixed a bunch of issues I had to fix on my own fork, but probably won't be on TACC for a while
3. Still not sure about why the pretzel-pretzel monomer separated by 30 X's is being automatically killed 30 min in.
